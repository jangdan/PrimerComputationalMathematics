    "## What is it?\n",
    "We have already considered the issue of temporal aliasing, which occurs when the sampling rate of our seismic data is too low to properly sample high-frequencies in the dataset. One of the solution is cutting away the aliased frequencies (> $f_{notch}$) using filters. \n",
    "\n",
    "As seismic data is sampled also in the distance $x$ dimension, a similar issue of spatial aliasing can occur. Spatial aliasing can result in inaccurate representation of dips in our seismic data, leading to issues with migration and other dip dependant processes."
